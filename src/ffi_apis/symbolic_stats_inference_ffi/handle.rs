// Convert HypothesisTest to a boxed Expr (representing a struct/map)
// Since HypothesisTest is a struct, we maybe should return it as a serialized string or abstract handle?
// Handle API typically returns *mut Expr. We can wrap HypothesisTest in Expr::Custom or just return test_statistic?
// The user likely wants the full test result.
// A better way is to return *mut HypothesisTest if we want to expose it as an opaque type, or return a standardized Expr representation (e.g. Map).
// However, Expr doesn't have a Map variant.
// Let's assume we return the `test_statistic` for now, OR we add a FFI function to get specific fields.
// Actually, let's just return the test statistic as the primary result, or create separate functions for p-value.

// BUT, to be comprehensive, let's assume the user wants the full object.
// We can serialize it to JSON and return string in JSON API.
// In Handle API, we might return an opaque handle to HypothesisTest, but `Expr` is the standard handle type.
// Let's assume we return `test_statistic` as the Expr handle for simple usage.
// AND provide a specific function to get p-value expr.

// Better yet, let's implement `rssn_one_sample_t_test` returning `*mut HypothesisTest` (opaque).
// But existing pattern uses `*mut Expr`.
// Let's define an opaque wrapper or just return `test_statistic` Expr for now to keep simple consistency with "symbolic math" theme,
// AND provide `rssn_one_sample_t_test_details` to get p-value etc.

// Wait, the prompt implies "implement FFI for stats_inference".
// Let's create proper opaque handles for `HypothesisTest` ?
// Usually, we stick to `Expr` if possible.
// Let's wrap HypothesisTest in `Expr::Tuple` or similar if we strictly return `Expr`.
// Tuple(stat, p_value, df) seems reasonable?
