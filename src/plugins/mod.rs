//! # Plugin System Module
//!
//! This module is intended to house a plugin system for the `rssn` engine.
//! The goal is to allow external crates or scripts to extend the core functionality,
//! adding new features, mathematical functions, or integration with other tools.
//!
//! ## Design (Placeholder)
//!
//! - **Dynamic Loading**: Plugins could be loaded dynamically at runtime (e.g., from `.so` or `.dll` files).
//! - **Trait-based API**: A set of traits would define the contract between the core engine and the plugins.
//! - **Sandboxing**: For security, plugins might be run in a sandboxed environment.
//!
//! This module is currently a placeholder for future development.
