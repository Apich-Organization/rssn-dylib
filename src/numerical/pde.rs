//! # Numerical Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Solvers
//!
//! This module provides numerical methods for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).
//! It includes placeholder functions and examples for common PDE types like Heat, Wave, and Poisson
//! equations, typically using finite difference methods.

/// Solves a Partial Differential Equation (PDE).
///
/// NOTE: This is a placeholder function. Real-world PDE solvers are
/// computationally intensive and typically require specialized libraries
/// (e.g., dedicated physics or numerical analysis crates).
pub fn pde_solver() {
    // Rust uses `println!` for standard output and requires a '!' (macro call).
    // Strings are typically enclosed in double quotes (").
    println!("PDE solver is a complex topic.");
    println!("For real-world solutions, please refer to specialized numerical libraries or our physics module.");

    // You could also return a placeholder result, like an Option or a Result type,
    // or take arguments that define the PDE and its boundary conditions.
    // Example: let solution = solve_using_finite_elements(...);
